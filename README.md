## Practice Assignment 1

In this assignment, I successfully connected a MySQL database to an Express server using environment variables. I started by initializing a Node.js project from scratch and setting up an Express server. To ensure security and flexibility, I created a .env file to store MySQL connection details like DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME.

I then installed the required dependencies—express, mysql2, and dotenv—and wrote a structured server.js file that loads environment variables, establishes a MySQL connection, and initializes the server. Additionally, I handled potential connection errors to ensure stability.

Through this process, I learned how to securely manage database credentials, establish a robust connection to MySQL, and implement proper error handling. This assignment reinforced my understanding of backend development and how databases interact with servers. I also practiced best coding practices by modularizing the database connection and pushing my code to GitHub for version control
